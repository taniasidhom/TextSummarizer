# Extractive Text Summarizer

Created a text summarizer by extractive summarization using cosine similarity. The program allows for the summary to be different lengths and maintains order of sentences. The output consists of a comparison dataframe between the original and summarized text based on combining the highest scoring sentences. 

The sample text used was the following article on Icelandic glaciers: http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20191212-icelands-newly-extinct-glacier.
